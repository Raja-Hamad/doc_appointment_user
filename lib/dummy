This application features interactive quizzes, in-app PDFs, and educational videos, all structured to provide an intuitive and engaging user experience. My role encompassed:

✅ Cross-Platform App Development – Crafting applications for both iOS and Android platforms using Flutter, ensuring consistent performance and responsiveness.

✅ UI/UX Design Implementation – Designing and implementing user-friendly interfaces that are both visually appealing and intuitive.

✅ RESTful API Integration – Seamlessly integrating APIs developed by backend teams to enable efficient data exchange and real-time updates.

✅ Firebase & Cloudinary Implementation – Utilizing Firebase for authentication, database management, and push notifications, while leveraging Cloudinary for optimized media storage and retrieval.

✅ Performance Optimization – Continuously monitoring and enhancing app performance to provide a seamless user experience.

✅ Testing and Debugging – Systematically identifying and resolving issues to maintain app stability and reliability.

I am proficient in Dart and have a solid understanding of object-oriented programming concepts. My expertise includes state management with GetX, API integration, and implementing scalable architectures. Additionally, I have experience working with Git version control in collaborative environments, ensuring smooth development workflows.

I am particularly drawn to Veoluxai because of your innovative projects that align with my skill set. I am confident that my technical expertise, problem-solving abilities, and passion for high-quality mobile development make me a strong fit for your team.
